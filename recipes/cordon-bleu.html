        A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped
        around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern
        versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked.

        Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients:
        chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple
        spices. It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint
        of Dijon mustard.

          <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat a 7x11-inch

            Sprinkle each piece of chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.
